# Spearmint Salad
This software is an implementation of the Sequential Model-Based Ensemble Optimization (ESMBO) algorithm [1].  It combines Spearmint [2] for fast hyperparameter optimization with the Agnostic Bayes theory [3] to generate an ensemble of learning algorithms over the hyperparameter space for increasing the generalization performances.
