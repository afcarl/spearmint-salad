# Spearmint Salad
This software is an implementation of the Sequential Model-Based Ensemble Optimization (ESMBO) algorithm [[1](http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0796)].  It combines [Spearmint](https://github.com/JasperSnoek/spearmint) [[2](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2012/Program/event.php?ID=3571)] for fast hyperparameter optimization with the Agnostic Bayes theory [[3](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v32/lacoste14.html)] to generate an ensemble of learning algorithms over the hyperparameter space for increasing the generalization performances.
